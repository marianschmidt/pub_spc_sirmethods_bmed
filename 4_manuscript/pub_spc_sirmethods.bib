  abstract = {Introduction Approximately 80\% of lung cancer cases in Germany are attributable to smoking. Patients with a lung cancer diagnosis may remain at increased risk of developing smoking-related second primary cancers (SPCs). Methods Anonymous data from 11 population-based cancer registries covering approximately 50\% of the German population were pooled for the analysis. Included patients were diagnosed with having an index lung cancer between 2002 and 2013, aged 30 to 99 years old at diagnosis, and survived for at least 6 months. We calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs)\textemdash stratified by age, sex, region, and period\textemdash comparing the incidence of smoking-related and other SPCs to the general population. Results Of the 135,589 lung cancer survivors (68.2\% male; mean follow-up 30.8 mo) analyzed, 5298 developed an SPC. In males, the risk was particularly high for SPCs of the larynx (SIR~= 3.70, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 3.14\textendash 4.34), pharynx (3.17, 2.61\textendash 3.81), and oral cavity (2.86, 2.38\textendash 3.41). For females, SIRs were notably elevated for the esophagus (4.66, 3.15\textendash 6.66), oral cavity (3.14, 2.03\textendash 4.63), and urinary tract (2.68, 2.04\textendash 3.45). When combining all smoking-related cancer sites, SIR was 1.41 in males (95\% CI: 1.36\textendash 1.47) and 1.81 in females (95\% CI: 1.68\textendash 1.94). We observed that males had a 1.46-fold (95\% CI: 1.37\textendash 1.56) and females a 1.33-fold (95\% CI: 1.20\textendash 1.47) increased risk for smoking-related compared with other cancers. Conclusions Patients with primary lung cancer were at increased risk for developing a smoking-related SPC. Therefore, the advantages of increased patient surveillance and the benefits of smoking cessation strategies should be considered.},

  abstract = {Background Lung cancer 5-year survival has doubled over 15 years. Although the risk of second primary cancer is recognised, quantification over time is lacking. We describe the incidence of second and higher order smoking-related primary cancers in lung cancer survivors, identifying high-incidence groups and how incidence changes over time from first diagnosis. Methods Data on smoking-related primary cancers (lung, laryngeal, head and neck, oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma and bladder) diagnosed in England between 2000 and 2014 were obtained from Public Health England National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service. We calculated absolute incidence rates and standardised incidence rate ratios, both overall and for various subgroups of second primary cancer for up to 10 years from the initial diagnosis of lung cancer, using Poisson regression. Results Elevated incidence of smoking-related second primary cancer persists for at least 10 years from first lung cancer diagnosis with those aged 50 and 79 at first diagnosis at particularly high risk. The most frequent type of second malignancy was lung cancer although the highest standardised incidence rate ratios were for oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (2.4) and laryngeal cancers (2.8) and consistently higher in women than in men. Over the last decade, the incidence of second primary lung cancer has doubled. Conclusion Lung cancer survivors have increased the incidence of subsequent lung, laryngeal, head and neck and oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma for at least a decade from the first diagnosis. Consideration should be given to increasing routine follow-up from 5 years to 10 years for those at highest risk, alongside surveillance for other smoking-related cancers.},

  abstract = {This article provides an update on the global cancer burden using the GLOBOCAN 2020 estimates of cancer incidence and mortality produced by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Worldwide, an estimated 19.3 million new cancer cases (18.1 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and almost 10.0 million cancer deaths (9.9 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) occurred in 2020. Female breast cancer has surpassed lung cancer as the most commonly diagnosed cancer, with an estimated 2.3 million new cases (11.7\%), followed by lung (11.4\%), colorectal (10.0 \%), prostate (7.3\%), and stomach (5.6\%) cancers. Lung cancer remained the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths (18\%), followed by colorectal (9.4\%), liver (8.3\%), stomach (7.7\%), and female breast (6.9\%) cancers. Overall incidence was from 2-fold to 3-fold higher in transitioned versus transitioning countries for both sexes, whereas mortality varied {$<$}2-fold for men and little for women. Death rates for female breast and cervical cancers, however, were considerably higher in transitioning versus transitioned countries (15.0 vs 12.8 per 100,000 and 12.4 vs 5.2 per 100,000, respectively). The global cancer burden is expected to be 28.4 million cases in 2040, a 47\% rise from 2020, with a larger increase in transitioning (64\% to 95\%) versus transitioned (32\% to 56\%) countries due to demographic changes, although this may be further exacerbated by increasing risk factors associated with globalization and a growing economy. Efforts to build a sustainable infrastructure for the dissemination of cancer prevention measures and provision of cancer care in transitioning countries is critical for global cancer control.},

The prevalence of continued smoking following cancer diagnosis is understudied. Methods In the multi-regional Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance cohort (lung cancer [N=2456], colorectal cancer [N=3063]), we examined smoking rates at diagnosis and 5 months following diagnosis and factors associated with continued smoking. Results 90.2\% of lung and 54.8\% of colorectal cancer patients reported ever smoking. At diagnosis, 38.7\% of lung cancer and 13.7\% of colorectal cancer patients were smoking; 14.2\% of lung cancer and 9.0\% of colorectal cancer patients were smoking 5 months post-diagnosis. Factors associated with continued smoking among non-metastatic lung cancer patients were: Medicare, other public/unspecified insurance, not having chemotherapy, not having surgery, prior cardiovascular disease, lower body mass index, lower emotional support, and higher ever daily smoking rates (all p{$<$}.05). Factors independently associated with continued smoking among non-metastatic colorectal cancer patients were male sex, high school education, being uninsured, not having surgery, and higher ever daily smoking rates (all p{$<$}.05). Conclusion Following diagnosis, a substantial minority of lung and colorectal cancer patients continue smoking. Lung cancer patients had higher rates of smoking at diagnosis and following diagnosis; colorectal cancer patients were less likely to quit smoking following diagnosis. Factors associated with continued smoking differed between the two groups. Future smoking cessation efforts should examine differences by cancer type, particularly when comparing cancers for which smoking is a well established risk factor versus cancers for which it is not.},

Despite this, many continue to smoke, with estimates ranging from 13\% to {$\sim$}60\%. Methods: Participants were 154 early-stage, non\textendash small-cell lung cancer patients who had smoked within 3 months before surgery. Patients were followed for 12 months after surgery to assess smoking status and duration of continuous abstinence after surgery. Predictors included medical, smoking history, psychosocial, and demographic characteristics. Results: At some point after surgery, 42.9\% of patients smoked; at 12 months after surgery, 36.9\% were smoking. Sixty percent of patients who lapsed did so during the first 2 months after surgery. Smoking at follow-up was predicted by shorter quit duration before surgery, more intense Appetitive cravings (expectation of pleasure from smoking), lower income, and having a higher level of education. Time until the first smoking lapse was predicted by shorter quit duration before surgery, more intense Appetitive cravings to smoke, and lower income. Among those who lapsed, greater delay before the lapse was associated with abstinence at the 12-month follow-up assessment. Conclusions: Nearly half of non\textendash small-cell lung cancer patients return to smoking after surgery if they have recent smoking histories. Most initial lapses happen within 2 months and occur in response to more recent smoking and more intense cravings. Findings suggest that interventions to prevent relapse should target those who wait until cancer surgery to quit smoking and should be started as soon as possible after treatment.

  abstract = {The number of cancer survivors who develop new cancers is projected to increase, but comprehensive data on the risk of subsequent primary cancers (SPCs) among survivors of adult-onset cancers are limited.To quantify the overall and cancer type-specific risks of SPCs among adult-onset cancer survivors by first primary cancer (FPC) types and sex.A retrospective cohort study from 12 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries in the United States, that included 1\,537\,101 persons aged 20 to 84 years diagnosed with FPCs from 1992-2011 (followed up until December 31, 2017) and who survived at least 5 years.First primary cancer.Incidence and mortality of SPCs per 10\,000 person-years; standardized incidence ratio (SIR) and standardized mortality ratio (SMR) compared with those expected in the general population.Among 1\,537\,101 survivors (mean age, 60.4 years; 48.8\% women), 156\,442 SPC cases and 88\,818 SPC deaths occurred during 11\,197\,890 person-years of follow-up (mean, 7.3 years). Among men, the overall risk of developing any SPCs was statistically significantly higher for 18 of the 30 FPC types, and risk of dying from any SPCs was statistically significantly higher for 27 of 30 FPC types as compared with risks in the general population. Among women, the overall risk of developing any SPCs was statistically significantly higher for 21 of the 31 FPC types, and risk of dying from any SPCs was statistically significantly higher for 28 of 31 FPC types as compared with risks in the general population. The highest overall SIR and SMR were estimated among survivors of laryngeal cancer (SIR, 1.75 [95\% CI, 1.68-1.83]; incidence, 373 per 10\,000 person-years) and gallbladder cancer (SMR, 3.82 [95\% CI, 3.31-4.39]; mortality, 341 per 10\,000 person-years) among men, and among survivors of laryngeal cancer (SIR, 2.48 [95\% CI, 2.27-2.72]; incidence, 336 per 10\,000 person-years; SMR, 4.56 [95\% CI, 4.11-5.06]; mortality, 268 per 10\,000 person-years) among women. Substantial variation existed in the associations of specific types of FPCs with specific types of SPC risk; however, only a few smoking- or obesity-associated SPCs, such as lung, urinary bladder, oral cavity/pharynx, colorectal, pancreatic, uterine corpus, and liver cancers constituted considerable proportions of the total incidence and mortality, with lung cancer alone accounting for 31\% to 33\% of mortality from all SPCs.Among survivors of adult-onset cancers in the United States, several types of primary cancer were significantly associated with greater risk of developing and dying from an SPC, compared with the general population. Cancers associated with smoking or obesity comprised substantial proportions of overall SPC incidence and mortality among all survivors and highlight the importance of ongoing surveillance and efforts to prevent new cancers among survivors.},
